## Hi there 👋
I’m Mohammed Faraz, a Computer Science student and aspiring software engineer.

I enjoy building things that mix logic, data, and real-world impact.
If an idea feels useful or challenging, I’ll probably try to build it.

Right now, I’m focused on machine learning projects, especially in healthcare, and full-stack applications where I handle everything from backend logic to UI.

My main tech stack includes Java, Python, React, Spring Boot, and Apache Spark.
I mostly work in VS Code, use Git/GitHub daily, and build ML apps with Scikit-learn and Streamlit.

I’m always learning, experimenting, and improving one project at a time.

Tools I use:
Java, Python, JavaScript,
Spring Boot,
MySQL, MongoDB,
Git, GitHub, VS Code, Streamlit

If you want to reach me:
GitHub: you’re already here 🙂
